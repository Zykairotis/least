# Least FAQ

## Which ChatGPT account should I use?

Use ChatGPT Plus or Pro with Apps / Developer Mode access.

Current testing shows free and Go accounts do not expose the app flow needed for Least.

Least does not unlock Developer Mode, unlock models, bypass account limits, or provide account access. It connects to the ChatGPT app surface your account already has.

Account access and model tool support are separate. A Plus or Pro account can have Apps / Developer Mode, while a specific model surface may still be unable to call connectors or MCP tools directly. Use the Pro context fallback for those sessions.

## What is the recommended install path?

Install globally once:

```bash
npm install -g least
```

Then run setup from the repo you want ChatGPT to work on:

```bash
least setup
```

After setup, daily startup from that same repo is:

```bash
least start
```

`npx least@latest start` still works as a no-install fallback, but the global install is easier for normal users.

## What do I enable in ChatGPT?

Open ChatGPT and go to:

```text
Settings
-> Apps
-> Advanced settings
-> Developer mode: on
-> Enforce CSP in developer mode: on
-> Create app
```

In Create App:

```text
Name: Least
Description: Local workspace bridge for ChatGPT coding
Connection: Server URL
Server URL: paste the URL copied by Least
Authentication: No Authentication / None
```

The copied Server URL already includes the private Least token.

## Should CSP stay enabled?

Yes. Keep Enforce CSP in developer mode enabled.

Least widgets are built for the CSP-enabled path. They do not need unrestricted network access, external fonts, remote scripts, iframes, or third-party images.

## Does Least bypass rate limits?

No.

Least does not bypass, avoid, increase, pool, resell, or modify ChatGPT, Codex, OpenAI, or third-party model limits. Every request still runs through the user's own ChatGPT session and whatever limits that account has.

The useful part is that Codex and ChatGPT are different product surfaces. If one workflow is unavailable and another product surface you already have access to is still available, Least lets you work against the same local repo without changing either product's limits.

## Can Least use GPT-5.5?

Only if your ChatGPT account already exposes that exact model, or a similar stronger model, in the ChatGPT web product surface you are using, and that model surface can call Developer Mode apps.

Some stronger planning-model surfaces may not be able to call the Least connector directly. Least does not provide, proxy, resell, or unlock models. It gives compatible ChatGPT sessions local repo tools.

For models that cannot call tools, generate a repo context bundle instead:

```bash
least pro-bundle --root /path/to/repo --copy
```

## What can ChatGPT see through Least?

ChatGPT can see explicit workspace context exposed by tools:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `.ai-bridge` plans and status files
- git status
- git diff
- selected source files
- file tree and search results

It cannot read hidden Codex runtime memory or anything outside the allowed workspace unless you explicitly allow that root.

## What can ChatGPT edit?

In normal coding mode, ChatGPT can write and exact-edit files inside the configured workspace.

Safety defaults block common sensitive paths:

- `.env`
- private keys
- `.git`
- `node_modules`
- generated build/cache folders
- symlink escapes
- paths outside the workspace

Use handoff mode if you want ChatGPT to write a plan only and let Codex execute locally.

## Which tunnel should I choose?

Use this rule:

```text
Fast demo:              Cloudflare quick tunnel
Recommended stable URL: ngrok free dev domain
Custom domain:          Cloudflare named tunnel
No public tunnel:       local-only mode, only for clients that can reach localhost
```

Cloudflare quick tunnel URLs change on restart. If you put a quick-mode URL into ChatGPT, you must edit the ChatGPT app Server URL every time you restart the tunnel.

For most users, the better path is a free ngrok dev domain. Create a free ngrok account, find your assigned dev domain under Universal Gateway -> Domains, and save that hostname during `least setup`.

If you own a domain, use Cloudflare named tunnels and route DNS to a hostname like `least.example.com`.

Official references:

- Cloudflare Tunnel DNS records: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/routing-to-tunnel/dns/

## Can ChatGPT and Grok use the same Least hostname?

Yes, with `--dual-client` on a public HTTPS tunnel (Tailscale Funnel, Cloudflare, or ngrok).

- ChatGPT should use `/mcp?least_token=<token>` with Authentication set to No Auth.
- Grok should use `/mcp-grok` with OAuth fields at `/oauth/authorize` and `/oauth/token`.

Both clients point at the same workspace and share the same Least bearer token. If both edit files at the same time, resolve conflicts in git like any other multi-editor workflow.

## ChatGPT says nitz connection failed but the connector still lists tools

That is usually public DNS, not a bad `open_current_workspace` call. Cloudflare's resolver (`1.1.1.1`) often returns NXDOMAIN for Tailscale Funnel `*.ts.net` names. ChatGPT still has a cached tool schema from an earlier handshake.

Keep Tailscale for your own machines. Point ChatGPT at a hostname Cloudflare can resolve:

```bash
npx wrangler login
least relay-deploy
least start --tunnel workers-relay
```

Or use an ngrok reserved domain / a Cloudflare named tunnel on a domain you own. After changing the ChatGPT Server URL, open a new chat.

## Can I use the same ChatGPT app URL every day?

Yes, if you use a stable hostname.

Recommended simple path:

```bash
least setup
# choose ngrok
# enter your ngrok free dev domain
```

After that:

```bash
least start
```

The same hostname and Least token are reused for that workspace.

## What if I run Least in two repos at once?

Use different local ports and different tunnel hostnames.

Example:

```text
repo A: port 8787, hostname A
repo B: port 8788, hostname B
```

Run `least setup` in each repo and save a profile per workspace.

## Why not use least.github.io?

GitHub Pages gives `owner.github.io` only to the GitHub user or organization named `owner`.

The `least` GitHub username already exists, so this repo cannot use `least.github.io` from the `Zykairotis` account.

The clean GitHub Pages URL for this project is:

```text
https://Zykairotis.github.io/least/
```

## Is Least production safe?

Least is a local developer bridge, not an OS sandbox.

Use it with repos you trust. Keep token auth enabled for public tunnels. Keep safe bash on unless you know why you need full bash. Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before exposing it through a public tunnel.

## Where are saved settings stored?

Workspace profiles are saved under:

```text
~/.least/profiles/
```

Use:

```bash
least settings
least settings list
least settings delete --yes
```

Saved tokens are redacted when profiles are displayed.
